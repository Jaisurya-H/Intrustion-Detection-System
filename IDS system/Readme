🛡 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) – Real-Time SOC Dashboard

A real-time, network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with a professional SOC-style dashboard, built using Python, Scapy, Flask, Socket.IO, and Machine Learning.

This project monitors live network traffic, detects suspicious behavior, and visualizes alerts and Wi-Fi usage in real time through a modern web dashboard.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Real-time packet capture using Scapy

✅ Rule-based intrusion detection

✅ Live alert generation and logging

✅ Real-time SOC dashboard using WebSockets

✅ Live Wi-Fi user activity monitoring

✅ System overview metrics (packets, alerts)

✅ Professional dark-themed UI/UX

✅ Industry-style architecture (IDS → Backend → Dashboard)

⚙ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

Python 3.9 or higher

Npcap (Windows users)

Enable WinPcap compatibility

Restart after installation

Administrator privileges (for packet capture)

📦 Installation Steps
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ids-soc-dashboard.git
cd ids-soc-dashboard
2️⃣ Install Required Python Libraries
pip install flask flask-socketio eventlet python-socketio requests scapy

(Optional – for ML module)

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
3️⃣ Verify Installations
python -c "import flask, socketio, scapy, requests; print('All dependencies installed')"
▶ How to Run the Project (IMPORTANT)
🔹 Step 1: Start the Backend Server

Open Terminal 1:

python realtime_app.py

Expected output:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Dashboard connected

⚠️ Do not close this terminal.

🔹 Step 2: Start the IDS Engine

Open Terminal 2 as Administrator:

python ids_realtime.py

Expected output:

Connected to real-time dashboard backend
IDS running with full SOC integration...
🔹 Step 3: Open the Dashboard

Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000
🔹 Step 4: Generate Network Traffic

In another terminal:

ping google.com -t
✅ What You Will See

🔴 Live Alerts appearing instantly

🔵 Wi-Fi usage table updating in real time

🟢 System metrics (packet count, alerts)

No page refresh required

SOC-style professional UI

🧪 Detection Logic

Counts packets per source IP

If packet rate exceeds threshold → alert triggered

Alerts are:

Printed in terminal

Logged to alerts.log

Sent to dashboard in real time
